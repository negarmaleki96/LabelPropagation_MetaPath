# LabelPropagation_MetaPath

# Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Representation for Social Networks

## Overview
We present a **dynamic heterogeneous graph** representation for social networks that captures:
- **Multiplexity** (multiple types of nodes and edges)
- **Time-awareness** (timestamps on every node and edge)

Our approach enables:
- Complex **time-dependent queries**
- Improved **classification accuracy** in dynamic networks

We introduce **Meta-paths + LPA**, a generalization of the Label Propagation Algorithm for temporal heterogeneous graphs, and show that it outperforms four state-of-the-art algorithms by **at least 13.79% accuracy**.
